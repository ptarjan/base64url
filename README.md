# `base64_url_decode`

Some simple samples of doing [base64 url decoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#URL_applications). Feel free to fork, add more (or fix these), and send me a pull request.

## TODO

* Add `base64_url_encode` to each language (same test cases)
* Add other languages that are common for web development
